## STEPHANE TRAUT

Hey I'm St√©phane Traut, Back-end web developer from France. I love programming in general and my goal is simpyl learn as much things as possible!
My current tech stack is mostly focused on JS/TS framework API developments and vanilla applications.

Check out the osbx project which is a library to generate .osb files using typescript and nodeJS!
